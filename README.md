# Corgpy

The final code for the project is: [corgpy.ino](https://github.com/saswatsamal/Corgi-Hacks/blob/main/corgpy.ino)

## Introduction
Corgpy is a smart puppy. He is very lovable and very moody also. He is very happy and cheerful when someone is around him and plays with him. But when no one is around he gets sad and depressed. We enjoy a lot when we play around with him and hope he enterains others also. 

## Overview
As mentioned it is a smart puppy just for people to play around. A lot of time people want to have a pet but either they cannot afford to have one or they don't have proper environment to raise one. This smart puppy is easy to build and cost-effective. This is an interactive puppy like if you give him some commands it does something in return. For example if we say "hi" to him then he waves his arms and his eyes lit up. When we say "bye", he goes back to his default positions. This can be a good past time plaything for children to play around with and it is relatively less harmful.
